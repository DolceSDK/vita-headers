	version of libgxm as this performs exhaustive validation of the memory address
	returned from this callback, which can degrade runtime performance.

	callback function failed to provide additional memory while the command list

/** Draws indexed geometry using a precomputed draw object.

	Drawing geometry using a precomputed draw object overrides all vertex streams
	currently set on the context. Instead vertex streams are used that have been
	set on the precomputed draw object.

	This function may only be called inside a scene or command list.
	When using the immediate context, calling this function outside of a scene will
	result in the #SCE_GXM_ERROR_NOT_WITHIN_SCENE error code being returned.  When using a deferred
	context, calling this function outside of a command list will result in the
	#SCE_GXM_ERROR_NOT_WITHIN_COMMAND_LIST error code being returned.

	Drawing geometry is only valid when both the current vertex program and
	current fragment program are non-<c>NULL</c>.  If either are <c>NULL</c>, this function
	will return the error code #SCE_GXM_ERROR_NULL_PROGRAM and nothing will be
	drawn.

	Drawing geometry flushes any pending state changes to the GPU, if any state
	has changed since the last draw call.  To reduce most of the CPU overhead
	involved in flushing state, precomputed vertex or fragment state can be
	used via the #SceGxmPrecomputedVertexState and
	#SceGxmPrecomputedFragmentState objects.  While using these objects has CPU
	cost benefits, using precomputed state can mean that you have a larger
	memory footprint than flushing state dynamically.

	If the current vertex or fragment program has a non-empty default uniform
	buffer, and if the precomputed state is not being used for that pipeline,
	the default uniform buffer needs to have been reserved or set. This is done
	by calling #sceGxmReserveVertexDefaultUniformBuffer() or
	#sceGxmSetVertexDefaultUniformBuffer() for the vertex pipeline, and by calling
	#sceGxmReserveFragmentDefaultUniformBuffer() or
	#sceGxmSetFragmentDefaultUniformBuffer() for the fragment pipeline.
	Failing to reserve or set a (non-empty) default uniform buffer before a draw call
	will result in the #SCE_GXM_ERROR_UNIFORM_BUFFER_NOT_RESERVED error code being returned,
	and	nothing will be drawn.  Once a default uniform buffer is reserved successfully,
	it persists until either the scene is ended or a different program is set on that
	pipeline.  When using the same program for consecutive draw calls, it is not
	necessary to reserve it again before the next draw call unless different uniform
	values need to be written.

	When drawing using the immediate context, the data for all GPU resources (textures,
	vertex streams and uniform buffers) needs to have been fully written to memory before
	the draw function is called.  This is because the immediate context may need to
	split a scene into multiple jobs internally to free up ring buffer space, which
	potentially causes the GPU to begin processing the draw call immediately after the
	function returns.

	When drawing using a deferred context, the writing of data for GPU resources
	(textures, vertex streams and uniform buffers) may be deferred until the
	command list containing the draw call is used on the immediate context.
	This is done by calling #sceGxmExecuteCommandList().

	If, when drawing using a deferred context, additional buffer space is required
	to generate GPU data structures, one or more of the #SceGxmDeferredContextCallback
	functions will be called to acquire more space.  Should the callback function fail
	to provide enough memory, the draw call will return an #SCE_GXM_ERROR_RESERVE_FAILED
	error code, and it will not be present in the current command list.
	Future draw calls on the deferred context will continue to request memory through
	the buffer callbacks and fail in the same way if the callback continues to fail.
	It is always possible to end the command list using #sceGxmEndCommandList(),
	and the resulting command list will still be valid to execute on the immediate
	context using #sceGxmExecuteCommandList(). However, only draw calls that succeeded
	without error will be present in the command list.

	@param[in,out]	context				A pointer to the rendering context.
	@param[in]		precomputedDraw		A pointer to the precomputed draw commands. The

	#SceGxmPrecomputedFragmentState objects.  While using these objects has CPU
	cost benefits, using precomputed state can mean that you have a larger
	memory footprint than flushing state dynamically.  To further reduce
	overheads, the draw call itself can be precomputed by using a
	#SceGxmPrecomputedDraw object with #sceGxmDrawPrecomputed().

	If the current vertex or fragment program has a non-empty default uniform
	buffer, and if you are not using precomputed state for that pipeline,
	the default uniform buffer needs to have been reserved or set. This is done
	by calling #sceGxmReserveVertexDefaultUniformBuffer() or
	#sceGxmSetVertexDefaultUniformBuffer() for the vertex pipeline, and by calling
	#sceGxmReserveFragmentDefaultUniformBuffer() or
	#sceGxmSetFragmentDefaultUniformBuffer() for the fragment pipeline.
	Failing to reserve or set a (non-empty) default uniform buffer before a draw call
	will result in the #SCE_GXM_ERROR_UNIFORM_BUFFER_NOT_RESERVED error code being returned,
	and nothing will be drawn.  Once a default uniform buffer is reserved successfully,
	it persists until either the scene is ended or a different program is set on that
	pipeline.  When using the same program for consecutive draw calls, it is not
	necessary to reserve it again before the next draw call unless different uniform
	values need to be written.

	When drawing using the immediate context, the data for all GPU resources (textures,
	vertex streams and uniform buffers) must have been fully written to memory before
	the draw function is called.  This is because the immediate context may need to
	split a scene into multiple jobs internally to free up ring buffer space, which
	potentially causes the GPU to begin processing the draw call immediately after the
	function returns.

	When drawing using a deferred context, the writing of data for	GPU resources
	(textures, vertex streams and uniform buffers) may be deferred until the
	command list containing the draw call is used on the immediate context.
	This is done by calling #sceGxmExecuteCommandList().

	If, when drawing using a deferred context, additional buffer space is required
	to generate GPU data structures, one or more of the #SceGxmDeferredContextCallback
	functions will be called to acquire more space.  Should the callback function fail
	to provide enough memory, the draw call will return an #SCE_GXM_ERROR_RESERVE_FAILED
	error, and it will not be present in the current command list.
	Future draw calls on the deferred context will continue to request memory through
	the buffer callbacks and fail in the same way if the callback continues to fail.
	It is always possible to end the command list using #sceGxmEndCommandList(),
	and the resulting command list will still be valid to execute on the immediate
	context using #sceGxmExecuteCommandList(). However, only draw calls that succeeded
	without error will be present in the command list.

	This function is only supported on the immediate context, and it will return the
	#SCE_GXM_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE error code if called using a deferred context.

	The <c><i>flags</i></c> argument contains information about scene dependencies and synchronization. See the documentation
	for #SceGxmSceneFlags for more details.

	The render target defines the how the surfaces are tiled for fragment processing, and provides resources
	for the firmware layer to schedule the job(s) for this scene. Within the render target, the set of valid
	tiles can be restricted to a subset of the render target using the <c><i>validRegion</i></c> parameter.
	If this parameter is not supplied, then the whole render target is considered to be valid. Only valid tiles
	are executed by the fragment pipeline. Geometry can be discarded at tile granularity by calling
	#sceGxmSetRegionClip() before drawing. Although the valid region must be static for the whole scene, region
	clip can change	between draw calls. Geometry, in tiles that pass region clip, is serialized into the parameter
	buffer for fragment processing.

	If the <c><i>colorSurface</i></c> is not <c>NULL</c> and is not disabled, the region in which color
	values are written to memory can be clipped at pixel granularity by calling #sceGxmColorSurfaceSetClip()
	on the surface before #sceGxmBeginSceneEx(). The <c><i>colorSurface</i></c> parameter does not need to
	persist in memory after the call to #sceGxmBeginSceneEx() returns.

	If depth tests other than NEVER or ALWAYS are required within the scene, a store depth/stencil surface
	must be provided that contains depth data as part of its format; this ensures correct behavior during a
	partial render. Similarly, if stencil tests	other than NEVER or ALWAYS are required within the scene,
	a store depth/stencil buffer must be provided that contains stencil data as part of its format. Attempting
	to use a depth test other than NEVER or ALWAYS with either a disabled store depth/stencil surface or a
	store depth/stencil surface with no depth data in its format will cause the draw call to return
	#SCE_GXM_ERROR_INVALID_DEPTH_STENCIL_CONFIGURATION. Attempting to use a stencil test other than NEVER
	or ALWAYS with either a disabled store depth/stencil surface or a store depth/stencil surface with no
	stencil data in its format will also cause the draw call to return #SCE_GXM_ERROR_INVALID_DEPTH_STENCIL_CONFIGURATION.
	If the depth and stencil tests will be NEVER or ALWAYS for all draw calls in a scene, the store depth/stencil
	surface may be <c>NULL</c> or disabled.  If a mask update fragment program is required within the
	scene, a store depth/stencil surface must be provided that contains mask data as part of its format; this
	ensures correct behavior during a partial render.  Attempting to issue a draw call that uses the mask
	update fragment program when the store depth/stencil surface does not contain mask data as part of its
	format will cause the draw call to return #SCE_GXM_ERROR_INVALID_DEPTH_STENCIL_CONFIGURATION.

	In order to have correct behavior during a partial render, the
	depth/stencil/mask components supported by the load surface must be a subset of the depth/stencil/mask
	components supported by the store surface. After a partial render, all depth/stencil/mask data is loaded
	and stored through the store surface only.

	The implementation of #sceGxmBeginSceneEx() also sets the region clip to clip all geometry outside
	of the render target, and sets the viewport to cover the valid region.  This is equivalent to calling:

	@code
	uint32_t xMax = validRegion ? validRegion->xMax : (renderTargetWidthInPixels - 1);
	uint32_t yMax = validRegion ? validRegion->yMax : (renderTargetHeightInPixels - 1);
	sceGxmSetDefaultRegionClipAndViewport(context, xMax, yMax);

	This function is only supported on the immediate context, and it will return the
	#SCE_GXM_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE error code if called using a deferred context.

	Executing a command list is implemented by placing jump commands in the
	VDM stream executed by the GPU during vertex processing.  A jump from the
	immediate context will jump to the start of the command list, and the command list
	VDM stream is patched to jump back to the immediate context.  Because of this, the
	command list must not be executed in another scene until vertex processing for
	this scene or, if using #sceGxmMidSceneFlush(), job is completed.

	To ensure the GPU is not given an illegal combination of region clip and valid region,
	the tile-aligned maximum Y value of region clip over all draw calls in the command list
	must be at most the tile-aligned maximum Y value of the valid region of the current scene.
	If this condition is not met, the command list execution will fail, and the
	#SCE_GXM_ERROR_INVALID_REGION_CLIP_IN_COMMAND_LIST error code will be returned.  This clamping
	operation is performed automatically for region clip state on the immediate context; for command
	lists, this restriction must only be handled manually since the valid region is
	not known at the time the command list is built on a deferred context.

	To ensure correct behavior during a partial render, if the command list
	contains draw calls that use depth tests other than NEVER or ALWAYS, the store
	depth/stencil surface for this scene must contain depth data as part of its format.
	Similarly, if the command list contains draw calls that use a stencil test other than
	NEVER or ALWAYS, the store depth/stencil surface for this scene must contain stencil
	data as part of its format.  If the command contains draw calls that use a mask update
	fragment program, the store depth/stencil surface for this scene must contain mask data
	as part of its format.  If any of these conditions are not met, executing the command list
