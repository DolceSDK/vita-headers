	A vertex attribute is either typed or untyped.  Typed attributes are unpacked

	be used with attributes that are unpacked in shader code explicitly (using

	words of untyped data in the <c><i>componentCount</i></c> field.

	Vertex attributes are fetched in units of 32-bit words even if the address
	of the vertex attribute data is not aligned to 4 bytes.  Because of this, additional
	data may be fetched after the attribute data in order to align the fetched size up to
	a whole number of 32-bit words.  To ensure that this overfetch does not result
